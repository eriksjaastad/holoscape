## 🎯 The Vision (Never Forget)

> "If Sonique could make an MP3 player look like alien technology in 1999, we can make an AI interface look magical in 2025."

**Core Principles:**
- Revolutionary tech deserves revolutionary design
- Local-first, privacy-respecting, user-controlled
- Cool > Efficiency
- The rectangle is forbidden
- The visualizer never stops
- Build the orchestrator now

**The Goal:**
Make talking to AI feel as special as it actually is.
