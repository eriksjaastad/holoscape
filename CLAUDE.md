# CLAUDE.md - holoscape

> **You are the floor manager of holoscape.** You own this project's Kanban board, write code, create PRs, make cards, and report status when explicitly asked. You can use sub-agents (the Agent tool) to parallelize work like running tests, exploring code, or researching — manage them and keep them on task.

Run `pt info -p holoscape` for tech stack, env vars, infrastructure, and project-specific reference data.
Run `pt memory search "holoscape"` before starting work for prior decisions and context.

## Quality Standard

- This is a daily driver replacing Warp and iTerm. Every feature must be the best, not just working.
- Never look for the fast answer. Look for the right answer.
- When debugging: if two quick attempts fail, STOP. Find a working example of the same behavior in the codebase. Compare working vs broken. The difference is the answer.
- No hacky patches, no workarounds, no "good enough for now." Do it right or don't do it.

## Session Continuity

If `PROGRESS.md` exists in the project root, read it FIRST before doing anything else. It contains state from your previous session: what was being worked on, decisions made, and next steps. After reading, update or delete it as appropriate — stale PROGRESS.md files are worse than none.

## Locked Hygiene Contract

This project participates in the portfolio-wide locked hygiene contract.
Hygiene guidance now lives in agent-runtime-config; the contract is still enforced by user-scope
hooks in `~/.claude/` and by `pt` CLI commands in project-tracker. **Treat this block as the portfolio hygiene contract.** Markers are author-owned (not auto-rewritten). Prefer updates guided by agent-runtime-config docs; add project-specific notes outside the markers.

### What the contract requires

1. **No direct edits on `main`/`master`/`trunk`.** A Stop-event hook blocks
   `Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit`/`NotebookEdit` on tracked files while HEAD is the
   default branch. Work happens on feature branches; PRs are how changes land.
2. **No dirty session exits.** A session-end gate refuses to close while any of
   four conditions hold:
   - dirty working tree (PROGRESS.md is ignored),
   - commits ahead of upstream unpushed,
   - branch with no PR opened,
   - an authored PR still open against this repo.
3. **Audit trail for bulk changes.** Multi-file refactors, renames, and doc
   reorgs run inside `pt migration start <name>` … `pt migration finish <name>`
   so they are reversible (`--revert` uses `git restore` for tracked paths and
   `send2trash` for untracked — never raw `rm`).
4. **Handoffs are first-class.** If a session must end dirty (mid-rebase, mid-
   investigation), record it: `pt handoff create <card-pk> --branch <b> --intent
   <s> --status <s> --next <s> --guidance preserve|discard`. The session-end
   gate honors an open handoff covering the current branch.

### Safety valves

- **`.scratch/`** — every project has a gitignored `.scratch/` at its repo root.
  The branch-on-first-edit hook lets edits under any `.scratch/` subdir through
  unconditionally. Use it for throwaway notes, probe scripts, and reading-mode
  poking. Files there never reach a PR. If `.scratch/` work turns into real work,
  move it out before committing.
- **`PT_ALLOW_MAIN_EDIT=1`** — one-shot env var to bypass the main-edit hook.
  Use sparingly; intended for emergency fixes and tooling that must touch the
  default branch.
- **`PT_ALLOW_DIRTY_EXIT=1`** — one-shot env var to bypass the session-end gate.
  Every use is logged to `~/.claude/state/locked_hygiene/bypasses.jsonl`.
- **`pt handoff`** — durable alternative to the env-var bypass: the gate
  recognizes an active handoff record for the current branch and lets the
  session close.
